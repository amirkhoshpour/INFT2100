Course Code: INFT 1207
Objective
Instructor: Md Al Maruf
Lab 1: Advanced Python
   In this lab, you will develop a Python program that generates secure passwords based on user- defined criteria, such as length, number of letters, digits, and special characters. The focus is on writing maintainable, well-structured Python code with unit tests to ensure reliability.
Teamwork Requirement
• This lab must be completed in pairs. Submissions by individual students will not be accepted.
• Collaborate effectively by distributing tasks equally and documenting your contributions.
Project Setup
1. Project Naming Convention:
o Create a new Python project in PyCharm and name it Lab1_GroupN (replace N
with your actual group number).
o File name should follow: Lab1_FirstName1_FirstName2.py (e.g.,
Lab1_John_Smith.py). 2. Project Structure:
o Create the following folders:
            Lab1_GroupN/
            ├── src/
│ ├── password_generator.py or Lab1_John_Smith.py
            │   └── __init__.py
            ├
            ├── README.md
            ├── requirements.txt
            ├── .gitignore
            └── LICENSE

Program Requirements
Develop a Random Secure Password Generator with the following features:
1. User Input:
o Ask the user for the total length of the password (minimum of 8 characters). o Prompt the user to specify:
▪ Number of letters
▪ Number of digits
▪ Number of special characters
o Validate inputs (e.g., negative numbers, exceeding total length, etc.). 2. Password Constraints:
o Must include uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters. o Randomly distribute characters as per user specifications.
o Handle exceptions gracefully.
Deliverables
1. Code Implementation:
o Ensure the code follows best practices, including clear naming conventions and
modularity.
o Include comments explaining key sections of the code.
2. Version Control:
o Upload your project to GitHub, ensuring:
▪ Source Code
▪ A well-written README.md file including Lab1 details o Submit the GitHub Link
3. Video Submission:
o Create a small screen-recorded video (5-10 minutes) presentation (both members
should participate) explaining:
▪ What this Lab 1 is about?
▪ Code walkthrough
▪ Program execution and results
▪ Task distribution between partners
o You can upload the video or link of your video presentation Submission Instructions
1. Submit the GitHub repository link containing all project files.
2. Upload the Group Video Presentation or provide a link to your video demonstration.
